"Press 1 HUMAN login and 0 for AUTO-MATED login:"
When you meet this message:
- If you want manual login, input 1.
- If you want auto login, input 0.

If you input 0, this message will be shown.

     "Enter your Email ID: "
     Please input your FB email here.

     "Password:"
     Please input your FB password here.

     "Enter Profile ID of receiver: "
     Please input message receiver FB ID(for exmaple: 100065878639306)

     After inputing above things, the Auto message will work well automatically.

If you input 1, you have to login by manually. But auto login is working well, so I suggest auto login.
